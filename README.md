# Flappy-Bird-Game-Development

This Repository is on Game Development using C# Language and Unity Game Engine.

The game created is "Flappy Bird".
In this game, the bird has to dodge the obstrucles(which are PIPES here) as it flies. 
As there is a gravity element in this game, the User will tap the screen and the Bird will fly vertically, thus dodging the Obstracles.
It also contains Animations for every action performed and User's score/high score are also scored.
